# Mechatronics Engineering Portfolio

This repository serves as a structured showcase of my applied work in mechatronics.  
Here I organize projects across automation, control systems, embedded development, CAD modeling, simulation, and industrial actuation.

The portfolio is divided into key technical domains:

- **Automation** – PLC logic, process control, industrial sensors, ESP32/RPi automation.  
- **Control and Simulation** – MATLAB scripts, Simulink models, PID tuning, motor and system analysis.  
- **Programming** – Python utilities, C++ applications, Java examples, automation scripts.  
- **CAD and 3D Modeling** – SolidWorks designs, assemblies, mechanical components, Blender animations.  
- **Robotics and Servomotors** – Torque calculations, actuator control, robotic mechanisms.  
- **Electropneumatics and Hydraulics** – Circuit design, simulations, pressure/flow calculations.  
- **IoT and Embedded Systems** – ESP32 and Raspberry Pi projects, sensor integration, communication protocols.

This repository functions as a technical laboratory where I document my engineering process and consolidate hands-on experience across multiple disciplines.  
More projects will be added continuously as I refine and expand my work.
