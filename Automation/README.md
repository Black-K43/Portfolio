# Automation Portfolio

This folder contains a collection of industrial automation projects developed as part of my engineering portfolio. Each project demonstrates the complete workflow used in real industrial environments: mechanical design, power sizing, electrical protection selection, control logic, documentation, and simulation/animation when applicable.

The objective of this folder is to provide clear and professional examples of automation engineering skills, including conveyor design, material-handling systems, motor selection, gearbox integration, and electrical control components.
